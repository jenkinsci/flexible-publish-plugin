<div>
Specifies a condition for execution on the parent build.
When a publisher works on a multi-configuration project, it runs in two ways in general:
<ul>
  <li>Runs on a build for each axe combination.</li>
  <li>Runs on a build for whole the project. It is often called aggregation.</li>
</ul>
For example, "Publish JUnit test result report" works in following two ways:
<ul>
  <li>Summarize JUnit results generated in a build with a particular axe combination.</li>
  <li>Summarize results of builds of all the axe combination as a result of whole the project.</li>
</ul>
</div>
